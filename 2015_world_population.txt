we use the dataset by CIA World Factbook and explore how the world population spreads across different countries.
The data has information from only 261 different countries  and the other country is world. It consists of 11 rows
(which is a combination of all the countries)

id - id number for each country.
code - country code, made from the two first letters of the country.
area - total area of the country (area_water + area_land).
population - population of the country
population_growth - ratio of the population growth in 2015
birth_rate
death_rate
migration_rate - ratio of people that left the country to another.

-- analysing data 

select max("area") as max_area_country,
max("area_land") as max_arealand_country,
max("area_water") as max_areawater_country from "worldpop";

-- minimum and maximum population growth and population of all the countries

-- The row "World" is the total of the whole database (261 countries). 
-- It does appear as the "country" with the max population (7.2 billions) in our query 
-- We need to write query accordingly, leaving "World" out of it. 

select min("population") as min_populated,
min("population_growth") as min_pop_growth,
max("population") as max_populated,
max("population_growth") as max_pop_growth from "worldpop"
where "name"!='World'

-- avgerages of population, population_growth and area 
select avg("population") as avg_populated,
avg("population_growth") as avg_pop_growth,
avg("area") as avg_area from "worldpop"
where "name"!='World'

-- Which country has the highest population?

select "name" from "worldpop" where "population" in (select max("population") from "worldpop" where "name"!='World')

--  Which country has the least number of people?

select "name" from "worldpop" where "population" in (select min("population") from "worldpop" where "name"!='World') order by "name" limit 1

-- Which country is witnessing the highest population growth?

select "name" from "worldpop" where "population_growth" in (select max("population_growth") from "worldpop" where "name"!='World')

-- Which country has an extraordinary number for the population?
-- as we can analyse from the data the name world which is actually a combination of all the countries has an extraordinary
-- number for the population.

select "name" from "worldpop" where "population" in (select max("population") from "worldpop")

-- Which is the most densely populated country in the world?
-- most densly populated could be described as the one whose population is more and the area is less i.e for a small area it should be having the most number of people living 

select "population","name","area" from "worldpop" where "population" > (select avg("population") from "worldpop" where "name"!='World') and
"area" < (select avg("area") from "worldpop" where "name"!='World') and "name"!='World' order by "population" desc
